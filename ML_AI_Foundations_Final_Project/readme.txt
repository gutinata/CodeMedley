This is my final portfolio project for Codecademy's ML/AI Foundations Skill Path

The dataset used is called Biological Data Of Human Evolution and is available in Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/santiago123678/biological-data-of-human-ancestors-data-sets?select=Homininos_DataSet.csv
I downloaded the data on March 13 2024

This dataset contains multiple variables coding characteristics of different hominids throughout human evolution

For this project, I aim to answer the following questions:

1. Is hominid cranial capacity correlated with variables related to diet (Incisor Size, Jaw Shape, Canine Size, 
Canines Shape, Tooth Enamel, Diet)? 
2. Is hominid height related to the habitat where species lived?  
3. How did the skull shape of hominids (Prognathism, Foramen MÃ¡gnum Position, Torus Supraorbital) change over time?
